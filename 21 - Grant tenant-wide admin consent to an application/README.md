## üßΩ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to grant tenant-wide admin consent in Microsoft Entra ID for a registered application. This process authorizes the app to access resources across the organization on behalf of all users, streamlining access without requiring individual user consent.

---

## üîç Objectives
Grant tenant-wide admin consent to an application to enable seamless access to required permissions across all users in the organization.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Admin Consent | Approving application permissions across the entire organization without individual prompts |
| Microsoft Graph | API that enables access to Microsoft 365 data and resources |
| Delegated Permissions | Permissions granted on behalf of a user |
| Consent Fatigue | Security risk and user experience issue caused by repetitive consent prompts |
| Entra Governance | Managing identity-based access at scale through centralized controls |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Enterprise Applications blade  
- Permissions > Admin consent workflow  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Navigated to **Enterprise Applications** within the Microsoft Entra admin center  
2. Located the pre-registered application to be authorized  
3. Reviewed the **required permissions** (e.g., Microsoft Graph ‚Äì User.Read)  
4. Launched the **admin consent workflow** and granted **tenant-wide approval**  
5. Verified the consent status through the application‚Äôs **permissions panel**

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- Successfully granted organization-wide admin consent for application permissions  
- Enabled seamless, delegated access to Microsoft Graph APIs without user prompts  
- Reduced friction during app onboarding while maintaining administrative oversight  
- Improved the organization‚Äôs readiness for scalable, secure app deployment  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
Granting tenant-wide admin consent is a strategic identity governance practice for modern enterprises. This capability:
- **Reduces consent fatigue** by minimizing individual user prompts  
- **Accelerates app adoption** across large organizations without onboarding delays  
- **Ensures permission transparency** through centralized review and approval  
- **Improves security posture** by maintaining visibility and control over API access scopes  
- **Aligns with Zero Trust principles** by enforcing strong access reviews and role-based delegation
