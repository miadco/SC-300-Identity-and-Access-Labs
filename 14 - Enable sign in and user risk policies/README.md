## üß≠ Overview  
This lab demonstrates how to enable and configure **user risk** and **sign-in risk policies** in Microsoft Entra ID. These risk-based policies enhance identity protection by automatically responding to suspicious sign-ins or compromised user accounts using intelligent signals.

---

## üîç Objectives  
- Configure **User Risk** and **Sign-in Risk** policies  
- Set thresholds for enforcement actions  
- Require MFA or block access for risky events  
- Validate configurations using the Identity Protection dashboard

---

## üí° Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| User Risk Policy | Detects users likely compromised and can block or force credential reset |
| Sign-in Risk Policy | Detects risky login behavior and can trigger MFA |
| Risk-Based Conditional Access | Automates access decisions based on detected risk |
| Microsoft Entra Identity Protection | Central location to manage identity risk policies |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Environment & Tools  
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Identity Protection > Risk Policies  
- Conditional Access (integrated risk response)  
- Sign-in logs and reporting dashboards  

---

## üìã Tasks Performed  
1. Accessed the **Identity Protection** section in Microsoft Entra admin center  
2. Configured a **User Risk Policy** to block or remediate users flagged with elevated user risk  
3. Targeted the policy to all users with enforcement thresholds set to medium or above  
4. Configured a **Sign-in Risk Policy** to require MFA for sign-ins determined to be high-risk  
5. Enabled and saved both policies  
6. Validated policy behavior via the **Identity Protection dashboard** and simulated risky behavior (if applicable)

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary  
Successfully implemented automated identity protection using risk policies. User and sign-in threats now trigger MFA challenges or account remediation, reducing exposure to compromised credentials or unauthorized access attempts.

---

## üíº Business Relevance  
In enterprise environments, risk-based identity protection policies are critical for:

- **Detecting compromised identities** using machine learning signals  
- **Enforcing policy-driven remediation**, such as blocking access or requiring password changes  
- **Reducing helpdesk burden** through automation of high-risk account responses  
- **Supporting compliance requirements** for secure authentication and risk detection (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST 800-63)  
- **Minimizing breach impact** by reacting in real time to sign-in anomalies and leaked credentials
