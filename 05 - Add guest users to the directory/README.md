## üß∞ Lab Environment & Tools  

- **Microsoft Entra admin center** ‚Äì UI-based identity management  
- **PowerShell** ‚Äì Automation tool for scripting bulk invitations  
- **External Identities > All Users** ‚Äì Directory view for guest account validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed  

1. Accessed **Microsoft Entra admin center** and navigated to **Users > New user > Invite external user**  
2. Manually entered guest user details to simulate individual onboarding  
3. Opened **PowerShell**, authenticated to Entra ID, and executed a script to bulk-invite multiple guest users  
4. Reviewed guest user entries under **External Identities** to verify onboarding success  
5. Observed the differences in onboarding experience and metadata between manual and automated methods

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary  

- Successfully onboarded both individual and bulk guest users  
- Validated their presence and details in the Entra directory  
- Demonstrated flexibility in onboarding methods suitable for small and large organizations  
- Reinforced understanding of secure collaboration across organizational boundaries

## üè¢ Business Relevance  

Modern organizations often collaborate with partners, vendors, and contractors. Efficient and secure onboarding of external identities:

- Reduces administrative overhead via bulk provisioning  
- Ensures governance through visibility and access control policies  
- Helps meet **compliance** requirements for B2B access  
- Supports seamless user experiences without compromising security  
- Prepares organizations for **Zero Trust** collaboration scenarios

This lab is especially relevant for environments with frequent or large-scale external engagements, including educational institutions, healthcare systems, consulting firms, and global enterprises.
