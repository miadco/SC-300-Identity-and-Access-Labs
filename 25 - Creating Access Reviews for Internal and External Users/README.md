## üßΩ Overview
This lab focuses on configuring access reviews in Microsoft Entra ID to monitor and manage user access, particularly for guest users, ensuring only necessary access is retained over time.

---

## üîç Objectives
Create an access review to periodically evaluate and govern user access to resources, reducing security risks from over-provisioned or inactive accounts.

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Access Reviews | Periodic evaluations of user access to resources and groups |
| Guest User Governance | Targeted reviews for users outside the organization |
| Reviewer Assignment | Delegating decision-making responsibilities |
| Lifecycle Management | Automatically removing unnecessary or expired access |
| Zero Trust Validation | Ensuring least privilege through recurring access checks |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Identity Governance ‚Üí Access reviews panel  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Navigated to **Identity Governance > Access reviews** in Microsoft Entra admin center  
2. Created a new **access review** targeting guest users with access to specific groups or applications  
3. Configured review parameters such as:  
   - **Reviewers** (e.g., group owners or selected users)  
   - **Review frequency** (one-time or recurring)  
   - **Decision settings** (auto-apply results, require justifications)  
4. Enabled the option to **automatically remove denied users** after the review  
5. Saved the configuration and **launched the review** for ongoing compliance monitoring  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- A live access review is now in place targeting guest users, promoting access hygiene  
- Organizational risk is reduced by allowing stakeholders to routinely validate entitlements  
- Unused or inappropriate access is automatically cleaned up, improving security posture  
- Access governance is now **proactive**, not reactive  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
Access reviews are a foundational aspect of **modern identity governance**. This lab supports real-world operational and audit scenarios by:
- Enforcing **just-in-time access** principles for internal and external identities  
- Supporting **audit readiness** with logs and reports of review decisions  
- Enabling **policy-driven automation** that saves time while maintaining strong oversight  
- Enhancing organizational **compliance** with regulatory standards like HIPAA, SOX, and GDPR  
- Reducing the **blast radius** from compromised or abandoned accounts
