## üìö About This Portfolio

All labs in this portfolio were based on the official SC-300 learning materials provided by Microsoft. You can access the same lab guides and resources I used at: [https://microsoftlearning.github.io/SC-300-Identity-and-Access-Administrator/](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/SC-300-Identity-and-Access-Administrator/)

This project demonstrates a commitment to hands-on, practical learning and a deep understanding of Microsoft Entra ID and identity security principles. It supports my career transition into Identity & Access Management (IAM), cloud administration, or security support roles.

## üß† Why This Matters

I was initially intimidated by Azure and the cloud as a whole. The platform felt vast, abstract, and full of stories about runaway bills from misconfigured resources. These SC-300 labs were my first real-world experience with the Azure platform, and they turned that fear into confidence.

I learned how to monitor my usage carefully, stay within budget, and use cloud services responsibly. More importantly, I turned the cloud from a theoretical concept into a working environment I can build in. This lab series proved to me that I not only understand these technologies, but I can work with them professionally and contribute to enterprise identity and access solutions.
