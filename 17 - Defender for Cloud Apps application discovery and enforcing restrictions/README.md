## üßΩ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to discover shadow IT and enforce governance policies through application tagging and access control decisions.

---

## üîç Objectives
Leverage application discovery and governance tools in Defender for Cloud Apps to manage cloud usage and enforce policy-based access restrictions.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Shadow IT Discovery | Identifying unsanctioned or unmanaged applications in use across the organization |
| Application Tagging | Classifying apps as Sanctioned or Unsanctioned for governance purposes |
| Usage Visibility | Reviewing metrics on app usage to guide IT and security decisions |
| Enforcement via Classification | Controlling access and applying conditional policies based on app status |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps  
- Cloud App Catalog  
- Application discovery and tagging interface  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Accessed the **Cloud App Catalog** in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps  
2. Located and reviewed usage metrics for the **Dropbox** application in the discovered apps list  
3. Tagged **Dropbox** as a **Sanctioned** application to signal organizational approval  
4. Validated the tagging status to ensure it reflected across the app catalog  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- Demonstrated the ability to monitor and classify third-party cloud applications  
- Enforced organizational policy by tagging Dropbox as a sanctioned app  
- Improved visibility into cloud usage patterns and enhanced governance posture  
- Practiced real-world application of Defender for Cloud Apps capabilities  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
In today‚Äôs SaaS-driven environments, organizations face risk from shadow IT and unmanaged cloud applications. This lab reinforces security best practices for:
- **Cloud app governance** using Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps  
- Proactive **compliance enforcement** by labeling apps as sanctioned or unsanctioned  
- Enhancing **security operations visibility** through app discovery and usage reports  
- Reducing risk exposure and aligning usage with corporate policy and audit requirements
