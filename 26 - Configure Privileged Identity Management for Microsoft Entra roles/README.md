## üßΩ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to configure and manage Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for directory roles. It covers assignment lifecycle, role activation, justification requirements, and secure removal of privileged access.

---

## üîç Objectives
Implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to ensure just-in-time access, enforce conditional activation, and manage role assignments securely and efficiently.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| PIM Role Activation | Temporary activation of privileged roles based on eligibility |
| Conditional Access | Requirement for MFA and justification during role activation |
| Role Assignment Lifecycle | Assigning, activating, and removing privileged access |
| Eligible vs. Active Roles | Distinction between standing eligibility and activated usage |
| Governance Practices | Enforcing compliance and minimizing persistent privilege risk |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)  
- Role configuration, assignment, and activation interface  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Accessed **Privileged Identity Management** and searched for the **Compliance Administrator** role  
2. Edited the role settings to require **MFA and justification** for activation  
3. Assigned **Monica Thomson** as **eligible** for the Compliance Administrator role  
4. Verified that Monica's eligible assignment was successfully applied  
5. Activated the role as Monica, entering the required justification text  
6. Assigned the **User Administrator** role to another directory user  
7. Removed Monica‚Äôs Compliance Administrator assignment to complete lifecycle testing  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- Successfully configured conditional access for privileged role activation  
- Demonstrated role lifecycle from eligibility ‚Üí activation ‚Üí removal  
- Enforced just-in-time access with proper governance measures  
- Reduced standing privileged access footprint within the tenant  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
This lab reinforces key operational and audit practices for secure identity governance:
- Enforcing **least privilege** and **just-in-time access** to critical roles  
- Supporting **audit trails** for role assignments and activations  
- Minimizing exposure to **lateral movement** and **privilege escalation** risks  
- Aligning with **Zero Trust principles** by requiring MFA and justification for sensitive roles  
- Simplifying **access reviews** with structured role lifecycle policies
