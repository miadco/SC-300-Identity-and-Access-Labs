## üß≠ Overview

This lab guides you through the process of configuring a **federated identity provider** in Microsoft Entra ID. Federated identity allows users from trusted external identity systems (e.g., SAML, Google, Facebook) to authenticate with your organization‚Äôs applications, enabling secure cross-domain access.

By completing this lab, you reinforce identity federation principles, enable flexible authentication strategies, and support business collaboration models aligned with Zero Trust.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Configure Microsoft Entra to support external identity providers.
- Add and customize a federated SAML/WS-Fed identity source.
- Test and validate cross-directory or social identity authentication flows.
- Analyze permission boundaries and session policies related to federated access.

## üí° Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept                                | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Federated Identity**                 | Linking identity systems to allow external user sign-in through a trusted relationship.     |
| **Cross-Domain Authentication**        | Enables third-party users to authenticate without creating native accounts.                 |
| **SAML/WS-Fed Configuration**          | Set up federated trust using widely adopted protocols.                                      |
| **Zero Trust Alignment**               | Ensures that all access‚Äîinternal or external‚Äîis authenticated and policy-enforced.          |
| **App Integration Security**           | Securely integrates apps that rely on federated identity providers for authentication.      |

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools

- **Microsoft Entra admin center**
- **Azure portal**
- **Identity providers configuration panel**
- **My Apps dashboard** (for verification)
- Optional: **PowerShell / Azure CLI** for querying directory settings
- **Audit logs** (for validation of federation policy enforcement)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed

1. Accessed **Microsoft Entra admin center** as a Global Administrator
2. Navigated to **External Identities > All identity providers**
3. Selected **SAML/WS-Fed identity provider** template to initiate federation
4. Configured essential metadata and URLs for the federated provider
5. Defined claims mappings and tested basic sign-in scenarios
6. Reviewed My Apps dashboard for user experience validation
7. Audited and verified the federation setup via directory logs

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary

Successfully established federation with an external identity provider in Microsoft Entra ID. This lab verified secure cross-domain authentication and improved organizational flexibility for external workforce and partner collaboration.

Learned the foundational steps to integrate third-party identity providers using secure metadata and protocol configurations.

---

## üíº Business Relevance

Configuring federated identity providers allows organizations to:

- **Support B2B collaboration**: Grant temporary, secure access to partners without issuing internal accounts.
- **Enable social identity sign-ins**: Facilitate self-service access for customers or volunteers.
- **Consolidate identity ecosystems**: Streamline authentication across subsidiaries, mergers, or external ecosystems.
- **Comply with access governance**: Apply conditional access, session limits, and sign-in logs even for federated users.
- **Accelerate digital transformation**: Support cloud-native and hybrid models through identity flexibility.
