## üßΩ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to register an application in Microsoft Entra ID and configure authentication, API exposure, delegated scopes, and client credentials. It also covers assigning custom roles for managing app permissions.

---

## üîç Objectives
Register an app in Microsoft Entra ID and configure the necessary identity, API, and permission settings to support secure authentication and delegated access.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| App Registration | Creating an identity object for an application in Microsoft Entra ID |
| Redirect URI | Specifies where the app receives responses from Entra ID after sign-in |
| Client Secret | Credential used for app-to-app secure communication |
| API Exposure | Allows external apps to request access via defined scopes |
| Delegated Scopes | Permissions granted by users/admins for accessing protected resources |
| Application Roles | Defines specific roles assignable to apps for fine-grained access |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- App registrations panel  
- API permissions and exposure settings  
- Authentication tab  
- Roles and administrators blade  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Registered a single-tenant application named `demoapp` in Microsoft Entra ID  
2. Set the application's redirect URI to `https://localhost` for local testing  
3. Created a client secret with a 90-day expiration for confidential client support  
4. Configured an Application ID URI to securely expose the app's API  
5. Created a delegated scope `Employees.Read.All` for read-only data access by users and admins  
6. Created a delegated scope `Employees.Write.All` restricted to admins for employee data management  
7. Defined a custom role with permissions to update credentials on service principals and apps  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- Successfully registered a secure app in Microsoft Entra ID  
- Implemented delegated access control via custom API scopes  
- Created and configured client authentication with expiration settings  
- Reinforced governance through custom role-based app access policies  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
Application registration and identity integration are essential for secure cloud development and enterprise SaaS enablement. This lab supports real-world business and audit goals by:
- Enabling **confidential and delegated access** for internal and third-party apps  
- Providing secure **API exposure and access control** using scopes and roles  
- Supporting **developer enablement** without compromising identity security  
- Allowing **auditable permission boundaries** via custom roles and tenant-scoped policies
