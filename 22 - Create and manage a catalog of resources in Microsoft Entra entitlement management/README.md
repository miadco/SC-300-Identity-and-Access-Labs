## üßΩ Overview
This lab demonstrates how to create and manage a catalog of resources using Microsoft Entra ID entitlement management. It covers catalog creation, role assignment, resource association, and access review configuration for external users.

---

## üîç Objectives
Create a custom catalog with associated resources, assign ownership roles, and implement access review policies to govern guest user access in Microsoft Entra ID.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Entitlement Management | A Microsoft Entra feature to manage identity-based access to resources |
| Catalog | A logical grouping of resources used to organize access packages |
| Catalog Ownership | Delegated administration for managing catalog contents |
| Access Reviews | Policies to ensure continued appropriate access for users, especially guests |
| Resource Association | Linking enterprise applications and other assets to a catalog |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Identity Governance > Entitlement Management > Catalogs  
- Enterprise Applications and Access Reviews configuration UI  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Created a catalog named **Marketing** and defined its properties  
2. Assigned **Amina Hadzic** as the catalog owner to delegate administrative rights  
3. Selected and associated **enterprise applications** as catalog resources  
4. Configured a **recurring weekly access review** for guest users  
5. Reviewed the **catalog overview** and confirmed resource status  
6. Deleted the Marketing catalog to simulate its full lifecycle  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- Successfully created and managed a catalog for identity governance in Microsoft Entra  
- Delegated ownership for catalog administration to reduce centralized overhead  
- Associated real enterprise applications to enforce scoped resource governance  
- Applied recurring access reviews for guest users to align with Zero Trust best practices  
- Cleanly removed the catalog after simulating its lifecycle and policy application  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
Entitlement management streamlines the governance of internal and external user access at scale. This lab reinforces:
- **Catalog-based delegation**, allowing decentralized teams to manage their own access controls  
- **Access lifecycle management**, reducing standing permissions and privilege creep  
- **Audit-readiness** through access reviews and catalog ownership visibility  
- **Compliance alignment** by enforcing time-based or recurring reviews for guest users  
- **Operational scalability** with structured resource grouping and role delegation
