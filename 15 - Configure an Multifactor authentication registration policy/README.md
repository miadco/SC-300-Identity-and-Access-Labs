## üßΩ Overview
This lab focuses on configuring a multifactor authentication (MFA) registration policy in Microsoft Entra ID. It highlights how to enforce MFA registration requirements for selected users or all users across the tenant.

---

## üîç Objectives
Set up and manage a policy that requires users to register for MFA in Microsoft Entra ID, strengthening the authentication baseline.

---

## üìò Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| MFA Registration Policy | Enforcing users to complete MFA registration before accessing services |
| Identity Protection | Using Microsoft Entra's Identity Protection to secure user identities |
| Tenant-Wide Enforcement | Applying registration policy across all users |
| User Readiness Validation | Ensuring users are prepared for secure authentication |

---

## üß™ Lab Environment & Tools
- Microsoft Entra admin center  
- Identity Protection > MFA registration policy settings  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed
1. Accessed the **Identity Protection** section within the Microsoft Entra admin center.  
2. Navigated to the **Multifactor authentication registration policy** settings page.  
3. Configured the policy to target **all users**, defining enrollment behavior.  
4. Reviewed policy state and toggled enforcement settings for validation.  

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome Summary
- MFA registration policy successfully created and applied to all users.  
- Policy settings confirmed via UI inspection.  
- Demonstrated ability to enhance identity protection through proactive registration enforcement.  

---

## üíº Business Relevance
Multifactor authentication is a cornerstone of modern identity security. By requiring users to register for MFA, organizations:
- Establish a foundational control aligned with **Zero Trust** principles  
- Proactively reduce risk from credential theft and phishing attacks  
- Meet compliance standards (e.g., NIST, ISO, GDPR)  
- Prepare the user base for Conditional Access and stronger access controls
