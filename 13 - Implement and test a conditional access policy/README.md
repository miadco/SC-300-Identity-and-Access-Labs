### 🛠️ Tasks Performed

* Created a Conditional Access policy targeting specific users and the **Sway** application
* Configured policy conditions and access controls, setting the policy to **report-only** mode for safe testing
* Used the **What If** tool to simulate policy enforcement for a selected user and app combination
* Reviewed simulation results to confirm the policy's expected impact prior to full deployment

---

### 🧪 Tools Used

* Microsoft Entra admin center
* Conditional Access policy editor
* What If simulation tool

---

### 💡 Key Concepts Reinforced

* Conditional Access policy design and configuration
* Report-only policy mode for non-intrusive testing
* Policy impact simulation using the What If tool
* Context-based access control using user, app, and risk conditions
* Fine-grained control of access to Microsoft cloud resources
